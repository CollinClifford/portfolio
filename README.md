First class project.

This is a basic website that I built as a class assignment to display my html and css skills.

When viewing the code you can see an early attempt to:
*use appropriate html elements with unique classes and ids
*seperate my webpage into appriopriate sections for SEO
*stylize using creative means but maintaining readibility
